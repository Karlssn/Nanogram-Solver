# Nanogram solver

## Background

So recently, my girlfriend and I have started to play Nanogram on our phones which lead me to want to create a version and a nanogram solver. Instead of starting with the Nanogram project itself, I started with the solver. 

This is was also a perfect opportunity for me to work more with .Net and c#. 

The plan to create a webapplication of Nanogram and then use this project as a autosolver.
